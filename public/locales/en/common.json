      {
        "question": "What exactly is a SaaS template?",

This means that you can launch your business faster, with a software solution that is tailored to your needs, without having to spend a lot of time and money on development. Additionally, our templates are designed to be user-friendly and easy to customize, so you can quickly make changes and updates as needed."

        "answer": "We base multiple bases (Landing, Users, Payments+Users) and after this, you can combine with 1 of our designs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the SaaS templates to fit my specific needs?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can customize our SaaS templates to fit your specific business needs.

However, our templates are designed to be easy to code and customize, even for those with limited experience with React or coding in general. We provide documentation and support to help customers with any technical questions or issues they may encounter during the customization process."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of support do you offer for your SaaS templates?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any limitations or restrictions on how I can use the SaaS templates?",
        "answer": "Yes, there are some limitations and restrictions on how you can use the SaaS templates, as outlined in BluePanda.dev's license. \n You are allowed to use the code to create unlimited end products, modify the code to create derivative code, and use the code to create end products for clients or for sale to end users. You are also allowed to use the code to create open-source end products that are freely available to end users. \n However, you cannot use the code to create end products that allow end users to build their own end products using the code, or redistribute the code or derivatives of the code separately from an end product. Additionally, you cannot share your access to the code with other individuals or create a repository of the code and publish it publicly. \n It's important to review and understand the specific terms and conditions of the license before using the SaaS templates. If you have any questions or concerns about the license or your intended use of the templates, you can contact BluePanda.dev at hello@blue-panda.dev."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much do your SaaS templates cost, and are there any hidden fees?",
        "answer": "The cost of our SaaS templates varies depending on the specific template you're interested in. Our prices are listed on our website and are transparent - there are no hidden fees. Once you purchase a template, you will have access to all of its features and updates for as long as your license is valid. "
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I try out your SaaS templates before I make a purchase?",
        "answer": "Customers can review the demo and screenshots of the SaaS templates on your website before making a purchase to get a better idea of the features and design."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why you say that save me hundres of hours by using this template?",
        "answer": "Using a SaaS template can save you hundreds of hours because it provides a starting point for your project. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the pre-built architecture, user interface, and functionality of the template as a foundation for your own project. This means you don't have to spend time designing and coding basic features, such as user authentication, user management, and payment integration, which can be time-consuming and complex. By using a SaaS template, you can focus on customizing and adding features that are unique to your project, which can significantly reduce the development time and cost."
